# Four in a row
Four in a row game with AI players

This is an old hobby project. Originally created in April 2019 together with 
[@Thom Sijpestijn](https://github.com/tomsijp). It is a small GUI application where one
can play four in a row against three levels of AI:
- A dumb AI, that will just play randomly,
- A medium AI, that will use Monte Carlo,
- A smart AI, that uses the minimax algorithm.

Uploaded in 2023 and checked to work with Python 3.11. No code changes made. 

## Playing
- Install the requirements
- Run the file ``four.py``
- Press 6 to go right and 4 to go left, press space to drop a stone.
